<h1> Credit Card Transaction Analysis Dashboard </h1> 
<h2>Introduction</h2>
In this project, I analyzed credit card transaction data to understand customer spending behavior and identify trends. The goal is to derive actionable insights that can help businesses optimize their strategies for customer engagement and revenue growth.

<h2>Tools and Methodology</h2>
• SQL Server: Used for managing and manipulating the dataset efficiently.<br>
• Power BI: Employed to create interactive dashboards that provide a visual representation of the data.<br>
• DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Implemented in Power BI to perform complex calculations and create dynamic data visualizations.

<h2>Data Preparation</h2>
The analysis starts with importing a CSV file containing credit card transaction data into SQL Server. I created a database and tables to store the data in a structured format. Once the data was in SQL Server, I connected it to Power BI to build visualizations and perform further analysis.

<h2>Key Insights</h2>
The analysis provides several key insights:<br>
<br>
• Revenue Analysis: Breakdown of revenue by customer demographics, including age, income, gender, and card type.<br>
• Spending Patterns: Identification of weekly spending trends and the most common types of expenditures.<br>
• Transaction Behavior: Analysis of transaction types (swipe, chip, online) to understand their impact on revenue.<br>
<br>
These insights help in understanding which customer segments are most profitable and which spending behaviors are most common.

<h2>Recommendations</h2>
Based on the analysis, I recommend the following strategies:<br>
<br>
• Targeted Marketing: Focus on high-income and high-spending segments to maximize revenue.<br>
• Customer Engagement: Develop strategies to encourage spending among lower-spending segments, such as Gold and Platinum cardholders.<br>
• Promotion of Online Transactions: Increase promotions to boost online transaction revenue, which currently lags behind other transaction types.

<h2>How to Run the Project</h2>
• Set Up SQL Server: Install SQL Server and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to manage the data.<br>
• Load the CSV Data: Import the CSV file into SQL Server following the setup instructions.<br>
• Open the Power BI Dashboard: Download and open the provided Power BI (.pbix) file to view and interact with the visualizations.<br>
• Connect Power BI to SQL Server: Ensure Power BI is connected to your SQL Server database to refresh and interact with the data.<br>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
This project demonstrates how data analysis and visualization can reveal deep insights into customer behavior and business performance. Using SQL Server and Power BI, I’ve identified key areas for growth and optimization in credit card operations.
